Unlike the first film, which focused heavily on violence, Barbera described the sequel as a \"dystopian musical\" and one of the most daring works in recent American cinema. After a private screening with writer Scott Silver, Barbera and his colleagues were left speechless, noting the film’s deeper exploration of darkness and complexity. Phillips, primarily known for comedies like 'The Hangover' trilogy, has transitioned to serious filmmaking, earning high praise for his innovative approach. Barbera, initially skeptical of Phillips, acknowledged his evolving talent post-'Joker.' Barbera also highlighted Luca Guadagnino’s 'Queer,' praising Daniel Craig's performance, and announced both films, along with Pedro Almodóvar’s latest, will be featured in the second week of the Venice Film Festival. These revelations have heightened anticipation for 'Joker 2,' which promises a distinctive, audacious addition to contemporary cinema.",

From zero exoplanet confirmations to over 5,500 in just a few decades, this new milestone marks another major step in the journey to understand the worlds beyond our solar system.The DiscoveryWith the discovery of six new exoplanets, scientists have tipped the scales and surpassed 5,500 exoplanets found (there are now 5,502 known exoplanets, to be exact).Just about 31 years ago, in 1992, the first exoplanets were confirmed when scientists detected twin planets Poltergeist and Phobetor orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. In March 2022, just last year, scientists celebrated passing 5,000 exoplanets discovered.Key Facts Scientists have discovered six new exoplanets — HD 36384 b, TOI-198 b, TOI-2095 b, TOI-2095 c, TOI-4860 b, and MWC 758 c — this has pushed the total number of confirmed exoplanets discovered to 5,502.",
