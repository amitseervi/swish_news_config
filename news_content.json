Sisters tied a Rakhi on their brothers' wrists, symbolizing prayers for well-being and a promise of protection. The festival included gift exchanges and family gatherings. Raksha Bandhan's auspicious time, or \"Muhurat,\" varies each year based on the lunar calendar. Generally, the festival is observed when the moon is visible on the full moon day of Shravana (usually in August). For accurate timing, consult a local Hindu calendar or Panchang, as the exact Muhurat can differ by region and year. Celebrating during this time ensures adherence to traditional customs and maximizes the festival’s spiritual significance.",
