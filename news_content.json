Processing 2,200 tonnes daily from Gurgaon and Faridabad, it causes PM2.5 and PM10 levels to exceed NAAQS limits. CPCB suggests measures like water sprinkling and developing a sanitary landfill. Local authorities must improve waste management. The report, following an NGT suo moto cognizance of a fire based on a TOI report, refers to Narhari Singh Banger’s commitment to compliance, including sprinkling treated water. Residents oppose new dumping sites. The next hearing is on Sept 5.",

From zero exoplanet confirmations to over 5,500 in just a few decades, this new milestone marks another major step in the journey to understand the worlds beyond our solar system.The DiscoveryWith the discovery of six new exoplanets, scientists have tipped the scales and surpassed 5,500 exoplanets found (there are now 5,502 known exoplanets, to be exact).Just about 31 years ago, in 1992, the first exoplanets were confirmed when scientists detected twin planets Poltergeist and Phobetor orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. In March 2022, just last year, scientists celebrated passing 5,000 exoplanets discovered.Key Facts Scientists have discovered six new exoplanets — HD 36384 b, TOI-198 b, TOI-2095 b, TOI-2095 c, TOI-4860 b, and MWC 758 c — this has pushed the total number of confirmed exoplanets discovered to 5,502.",
