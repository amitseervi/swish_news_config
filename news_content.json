Nandy, a Labour MP since 2010, secured her seat in Wigan by defeating her rival Andy Dawber with a margin of nearly 10,000 votes in the recent general election, which marked a significant comeback for the Labour Party. Lisa Nandy is the daughter of academic Dipak Nandy and Ann Luise Byers. In 2020, she contested for the Labour leadership, finishing third behind Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey.",

From zero exoplanet confirmations to over 5,500 in just a few decades, this new milestone marks another major step in the journey to understand the worlds beyond our solar system.The DiscoveryWith the discovery of six new exoplanets, scientists have tipped the scales and surpassed 5,500 exoplanets found (there are now 5,502 known exoplanets, to be exact).Just about 31 years ago, in 1992, the first exoplanets were confirmed when scientists detected twin planets Poltergeist and Phobetor orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. In March 2022, just last year, scientists celebrated passing 5,000 exoplanets discovered.Key Facts Scientists have discovered six new exoplanets — HD 36384 b, TOI-198 b, TOI-2095 b, TOI-2095 c, TOI-4860 b, and MWC 758 c — this has pushed the total number of confirmed exoplanets discovered to 5,502.",

Arizona Senator Mark Kelly is also a notable contender. Speculative suggestions like Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey are deemed unlikely.",
