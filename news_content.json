This new perspective aims to address the inconsistencies between our best theories of the universe, which have hindered the development of a unified \"theory of everything.\" Researchers have suggested that by considering time as a result of quantum entanglement, the mysterious connection between two distant particles, they might solve this long-standing problem. The study, published on May 10 in the journal Physical Review A, explores this idea.",

From zero exoplanet confirmations to over 5,500 in just a few decades, this new milestone marks another major step in the journey to understand the worlds beyond our solar system.The DiscoveryWith the discovery of six new exoplanets, scientists have tipped the scales and surpassed 5,500 exoplanets found (there are now 5,502 known exoplanets, to be exact).Just about 31 years ago, in 1992, the first exoplanets were confirmed when scientists detected twin planets Poltergeist and Phobetor orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. In March 2022, just last year, scientists celebrated passing 5,000 exoplanets discovered.Key Facts Scientists have discovered six new exoplanets — HD 36384 b, TOI-198 b, TOI-2095 b, TOI-2095 c, TOI-4860 b, and MWC 758 c — this has pushed the total number of confirmed exoplanets discovered to 5,502.",
