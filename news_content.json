A complaint was filed when a victim realized he couldn't withdraw his deposited money after following instructions from 'Ishika Reddy'. Further investigation revealed Utsav Chaturvedi, an assistant manager at ICICI Bank, had helped open the fraudulent account. This case adds to the 17 bank employees already arrested in Gurgaon for cyber fraud.",

Non-surgical alternatives like dermal fillers offer immediate results. Dr. Anmol Chugh and Dr. Adhishwar Sharma emphasized the importance of choosing certified plastic surgeons and using FDA-approved products. Post-procedure care is crucial, including avoiding smoking and heavy exercise. Prices for fillers range from Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 per millilitre, while surgical procedures can cost between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh.",
