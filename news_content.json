Jeffrey Vandersay's superb six-wicket haul for 33 runs dismantled the Indian batting lineup, leading to India’s collapse from 97 for 1 to 208 all out. Rohit Sharma's 64 and Shubman Gill's 35 set a strong foundation, but Vandersay's spin proved too challenging, dismissing key players including Sharma and Virat Kohli. Sri Lanka’s lower-order contributions and effective spin bowling were crucial in setting a competitive total and securing the win.",
